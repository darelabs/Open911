Open911 is an open source community-driven mobile app for reporting emergencies.




## Why open?

We built it as open so anyone can contirbute to making it more secure and useful. Also since it's open source you can adapt it anyway you like.




## How is it supposed to work?

Open911 was built with two scenarios in mind:

1. A person is in an emergency situation and cannot do anything apart from hit a button (or two)
2. A person witnesses an emergency and has reasonable time to describe the event

When the app is launched, Open911 gathers the user's location and submits a generic emergency request indicating the user's location. If, as in the case of scenario 2, the user describes the event, Open 911 will submit the user's description together with the location of the emergency.




## Where does the emergency request go?

For now, it's posted to the public twitter account [@dareworksgh](https://twitter.com/dareworksgh) so all can see and anyone can help.




## Can I test it?

Sure, we're releasing two identical versions - one for test and one for live. The idea is if you find the test app useful, then install the live version instead. What's the difference between the two apps? The test app posts with the hash tag [#gh911_test](https://twitter.com/hashtag/gh911_test) whereas the live app posts with the hashtag [#gh911](https://twitter.com/hashtag/gh911). We seperated the two so you can try the app without raising false alarms.





## Cool app. How can I help?

:smile: Thanks for the compliment and thank you for asking. There's a lot that we're hoping to do with Open 911 and with your help we can evolve it much faster. A few of our ideas are as follows:

- [ ] Including pictures in emergency requests for scenario 2
- [ ] Including audio in emergency requests for both scenarios
- [ ] Including code to identify user making request (since for most countries mobile numbers are registered we would like to use the mobile numbers). This is meant to discourage abuses of the system
- [ ] Making it possible for 'volunteers' (eg law enforcement agencies, journalists) to be notified when there's an emergency in their vicinity so they can offer assistance
- [ ] Allowing abuses of the system to be flagged
- [ ] Allowing confirmed abusers to be banned
- [ ] Posting requests to a site designed specifically for that purpose. That way we can carry out some analysis of emergency incidents.
- [ ] Many many more


With such a growing list of features any assistance is more than welcome.
A few suggestions on how you can help:

- [ ] Recommend the app to a friend, blog about it or post a note on your wall.
- [ ] Contribute code
- [ ] Help review contributed code (especially for saftey)
- [ ] Help improve our UI. 
- [ ] Suggest features we can implement bearing in mind the two scenarios enumerated earlier.
- [ ] Contribute tests



Thank you
